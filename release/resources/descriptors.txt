There is a stone bench on the far side.
The dilapidated stone statue of an angel stands in the center./The dilapidated stone statue of a demon stands in the center./The dilapidated stone statue of a pagan god stands in the center./A well preserved stone statue of an angel stands in the center./A well preserved stone statue of a demon stands in the center./A well preserved stone statue of a pagan god stands in the center.
There are empty crates in the corner./There is an old wooden desk in the corner./There is a round end table with a burnt out candle in the corner./There is a round end table with a lit candle in the corner.
Various debris lays scattered across the cold stone floor, forgotten./Various debri lays scattered across the rotten wood floor, forgotten.
The walls are made of stone./The walls are made of wood./The walls are decorated with ancient depictions of gods./The walls are decorated with ancient depictions of demons./ The walls are covered with dusty tapestries.
The room is open to the sky, freedom right there, but too far to reach; a mockery of your entrapment./The ceiling is tall and hidden in darkness./The ceiling is low and claustrophobic./The ceiling is painted with a mural too faded and cracked to understand./The ceiling is painted with a beautiful mural.
The walls are adorned with torches which burned mythical blue./The walls are adorned with torches which burned an ominous blood red./The walls are adorned with torches./The walls are adorned with burned out torches./The walls are adorned with candles that should have burned out long ago./The room is dimly lit by some unseen force.
